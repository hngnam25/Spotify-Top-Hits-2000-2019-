# Spotify-Top-Hits-2000-2019

## Project Introduction
* This data project is an EDA project looking at data from Spotify's Top Hits from 2000 to 2019
* The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze the datasets of Spotify, as well as visualize some of those patterns

## Code and Resource used
**Python Version:** 3.9
* Packages: panda, numpy, matplotlib,seaborn, plotly
* Warning: As plotly as html graphs that can not be displayed statically on Github, I highly advised that this project is downloaded. I will posting most of the plotly graph down below and attach a static version for convenience sake!

## EDA Highlights
Below are some of the highlight of the project
![Feature Distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112133254/193358774-d8fc6d62-4328-4ac2-ae19-480e0d1bff52.png)
* **Insight:** Most top hit songs' features are not normally distributed and rather skewed right for danceability, energy, loudness and valence,but skew left for liveness, speechiness and acousticness.

![Top 25 ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112133254/193360080-e40bda6d-ad66-4f93-bc2d-6d8c0758a7f4.png)
* **Insight:** The top 3 most played songs are actually Sweater Weather (The Neighbourhood), Another Love (Tom Odell) and Without Me (Eminem)! Surprising!

![Top songs genre](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112133254/193361910-257d2f1c-6ff8-410d-9c34-c71a15c9da67.png)
* **Insight:** While the top genre of all hits songs is pop, the median genre for all songs is hip hop, pop, R&B and Latin

![En vs Pop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112133254/193361551-906b139a-1975-4478-8c09-fc7f897ea638.png)

* **Insight:** It seems like popular songs are often more energetic and danceable

* **Insight:** For the top 5 artists, most of their songs have become more danceable and become shorter during this period
